# Ebay Sticky Search

## Introduction

Tiny Chrome extension that makes advanced search preferences sticky. Avoids
having to manually select preferences such as "UK Only" every time you perform a
Ebay search.

## Usage

Drag ebay-sticky-search.crx onto the Chrome extensions tab to install it.

## Limitations

I threw this together very quickly, some limitations:

- UK Ebay domains hard-coded, so won't work for other countries.
- Search preferences are lost each time the Advanced Search page is viewed.
- Not in Chrome Web Store so updates won't work.
- Does not save search preferences to storage, so they are lost after Chrome
  restarts.
- No icon.
