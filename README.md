# Sticky Search

## Introduction

Tiny Chrome extension that makes advanced search preferences sticky. Avoids
having to manually select preferences such as "UK Only" every time you perform
an Ebay search.

## Installation

1. Download the [ebay-sticky-search.crx](https://github.com/kzar/ebay-sticky-search/raw/master/ebay-sticky-search.crx) file.
2. Open the Google Chrome Settings screen.
3. Switch to the Extensions tab.
4. Drag the ebay-sticky-search.crx file onto Chrome.

## Usage

Each time you perform an advanced search on Ebay your preferences will be saved
and re-used until you next perform an advanced search. (If you want to clear all
saved preferences simply view the advanced search page and then close it,
without performing a search.)
