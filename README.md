# Ebay Sticky Search

## Introduction

Tiny Chrome extension that makes advanced search preferences sticky. Avoids
having to manually select preferences such as "UK Only" every time you perform a
Ebay search.

## Installation

1. Download the [ebay-sticky-search.crx](https://github.com/kzar/ebay-sticky-search/raw/master/ebay-sticky-search.crx) file.
2. Open the Google Chrome Settings screen.
3. Switch to the Extensions tab.
4. Drag the ebay-sticky-search.crx file onto Chrome.

## Usage

1. Perform an advanced search on ebay.co.uk.
2. Further searches will re-use the selected search preferences until the
   advanced search page is next displayed or Chrome is restarted.

## Limitations

I threw this together very quickly, some limitations:

- UK Ebay domains hard-coded, so won't work for other countries.
- Not in Chrome Web Store so updates won't work.
- No icon.
